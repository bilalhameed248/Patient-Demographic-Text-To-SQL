Text-to-SQL Patient Demographic Chatbot with RAG and LangChain
This repository contains the implementation of a cutting-edge Text-to-SQL Patient Demographic Chatbot, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain for seamless interaction with patient demographic data.

Features:
Natural Language Interface: Enables users to query patient demographic data using natural language.
Text-to-SQL Conversion: Automatically translates user queries into SQL statements for precise database interaction.
RAG Technology: Integrates a retrieval mechanism to provide accurate and context-aware responses by combining external knowledge sources and the language model.
LangChain Integration: Harnesses LangChain for efficient query parsing, chaining, and response generation.
User-Friendly: Designed for healthcare professionals and administrators to easily retrieve patient data without technical expertise in SQL.
Technology Stack:
LangChain: For robust query processing and chaining.
RAG Framework: To enhance response accuracy by utilizing external data retrieval.
Database Integration: Supports SQL databases containing patient demographic information.
Python: Primary language for implementation, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
Use Cases:
Quickly retrieve patient demographics by asking natural language questions (e.g., "Show me all patients aged above 60").
Enable healthcare administrators to interact with data without the need for technical skills in SQL or database management.
Improve data accessibility and streamline decision-making processes in healthcare organizations.
Installation and Usage:
Clone this repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Configure the database connection in the config.json file.
